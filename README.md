# Private email warning

Browser extension (tested on Chrome & Firefox) that warns me if I use my personal email to send a work email within Gmail.

The main script is in [`extension/src/extension.ts`](./extension/src/extension.ts).
The extension uses the [gmail.js](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/gmail.js/) library.
